    | Planet is a two-tiered earth-imitating interactive chat space.
    | Within the white first tier, you may create doors that lead to secondary
    | rooms. Within those secondary rooms, you may interact and leave messages about a specfic subject.
    | Planet is functional and welcomes all discussions. Technical
    | instructions can always be found in the upper-right hand corner. Connect with
    | people from everywhere in the world all from your very own room. A Planet
    | is reborn anew every week: everything you've done is wiped clean. You can say
    | the right thing next week. You may not leave planet, only fall asleep. When
    | you return, you'll wake up right where you left. Planet is infinite. Be careful.
    | You can be anyone you want, starting today.
